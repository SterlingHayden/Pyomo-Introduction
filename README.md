# Pyomo-Introduction

Pyomo is an open-source optimization modeling language for Python, this repo is my first attempts of optimization using the folowing packages:

1. CBC: For solving linear programs and mixed integer linear programs.
2. Ipopt: Suited for nonlinear programs, even those that are nonconvex.
3. Bonmin: Useful for mixed integer nonlinear programs with convex continuous relaxation.
4. Couenne: Designed for solving mixed integer nonlinear programs.
